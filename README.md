# JOSM-MapCSS-styles

You need to save Africa.css as Africa.css.zip (i.e. just add the extension .zip). 

In JOSM: Preferences > Map > Map Paint Styles > Active Styles > +

Or use the right-most button in the Map Paint Styles panel. 

You may need to re-order / de-activate other styles in the Map Paint Styles panel.
